## What did I Learned
* class-variance-authority: Its a javascript library used to create variant used to create Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) variants more efficiently.CVA can be used to give more control over stylesheet output.
* lucide-react: I didn't know this library that is awesome to use icons in your project. It is a beautiful and consistent icon toolkit made by the community.
* Used lib folder for the first time. This folder is for preparing some libraries to be used in the app.
* I used tailwind merge and clsx to reuse some components and give them the possibility of having their own styles and to conditionally render those styles.
* This was my first time using Redis for my database. I applied this in-memory data sctructured store used as a database with the help of Upstash to manage redis in a more simple way
* Used react-hot-toast to show the user notifications
